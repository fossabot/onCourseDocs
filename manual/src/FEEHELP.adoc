[[FEEHELP-whatIs]]
=== What are VET Student Loans?

In the onCourse context, VET Student Loans are a type of database export and reporting standard for students enrolled in courses for which they can apply for a government study loan.

More information about the current reporting standard can be found on the http://heimshelp.education.gov.au[Heims Help website]

VET Student Loans are available to assist eligible students studying approved Diploma level and above VET Qualifications to pay their tuition fees. Part, or all, of an eligible student's tuition fees can be deferred into VET Student Loan, up to a capped amount. Some Government funded course fees can also be deferred under the VET Student Loan scheme.

An RTO needs to be pre-approved to offer VET Student Loans on some or all of their courses. If you are an approved RTO, onCourse Fee Help functions will enable you to meet your reporting and record keeping obligations.

Set your Fee Help Provider Code in the AVETMISS general preferences panel to export your VET Student Loan files with your code embedded.

[[FEEHELP-Creating]]
=== Creating a VET Student Loan eligible course

onCourse Courses are used to map to both the VSL courses and VSL units of study. The way you set this up in onCourse is by creating a parent course as the VSL course, and then another course for each unit of study - e.g. if there are four units of study to the course, then you'd make four more courses.

You can set the course's modules in the parent course, or within each unit of study course. Either way will work.

You'll need to set a relation between all these courses soon, but first, in the course VET section, you will need to begin by checking the option 'This is a VET Student Loan eligible class'. This will show the additional VSL fields.

* This is a VET Student Loan eligible class - When ticked, sets the course as VSL enabled and displays further VSL related fields.
* Type of attendance - select from Full time or Part Time
* Equivalent full-time student load - this must be expressed as a whole number where 1 = a full time student load, 05 is 50% of a full time load and 0125 is equal to 1/8th of a full time student load.

When creating VSL class records within VSL courses, the following fields are available to set:

* Census date - This is the last date students can withdraw before incurring the course VET Student Loan fee. This must match your pre-approved census dates for the course or subject. This only displays when the parent course has 'This is a VET Student Loan eligible class' ticked.
* Reporting period - This is the year and semester period in the format YYYYp. A valid entry in this field would be 20151 or 20152

Make sure each field is set correctly for the course/unit of study you're creating.

The last step is these courses then need to be connected with a special type of relation called 'Higher Education'. From within the parent course record, go to Relations and create a relationship with each of the applicable unit of study courses you've made, using relation 'Unit of study (Higher education)'. Make sure that each unit of study course has this relationship with the parent course. If viewing a unit of study course, the relationship to the parent course will appear as 'Course (Higher Education)'.

[[FEEHELP-studentEligibility]]
=== Setting the Student's VET Student Loan eligibility

For all students enrolled in a class where VET Student Loans are available, every participant must have additional data in their student VET section record completed, even if they are not applying for a loan.

You will need to create and record a CHESSN for each student, and complete the student's contact details and AVETMISS questions responses as usual.

There are some additional fields in the VET section of a contact record that need to be completed if the student is applying for VET FEE-HELP. You will need to mark the checkbox called 'VET FEE-HELP eligible' for them to appear, these are:

* Citizenship status - select an option from the drop down box
* Tax file number - record the number provided by the student which they have obtained from the ATO

[[FEEHELP-loanRequests]]
=== Student VET Student Loan requests

Every enrolment record has a VET Student Loans section that is used to record the VET Student Loan request, or report that the student doesn't wish to apply for a loan.

The fee charged field will show the enrolment fee the student was charged. This data is tied to the invoices generated is not editable in their enrolment record.

In the FEE HELP requested field, you can indicate that the student doesn't wish to apply for a loan by leaving the default value as $0.00 or enter an amount up to the full class fee.

The loan fee will be calculated based on the value you have set in the Fee Subsidy drop down box. Non-state government subsidised courses will incur a 20% loan fee that you'll see added to the Total Loan amount. Subsidised courses incur no loan fee.

You can also override the Type of Attendance information at the enrolment level. By default, the enrolment will inherit the attendance type of the class, but you can change it here if you have students attending the same class, but with different attendance types.

Beyond this required data, you can optionally complete the fields in the section headed 'Credit and RPL'. Leave the fields blank that do not apply this student's enrolment.

* Credit offered value - This field contains EFTSL value of the credit/RPL offered at the reporting date towards the total requirements of the course and can contain values from 0001 to 9999.
* Credit used value - This field should report the sum total value of all credit/RPL used by a student toward their current course, at the reporting date.
The value reported in this element must be less than or equal to the value reported in the 'Credit offered value' and can contain values from 0001 to 9999.
* RPL Indicator - select from the drop down list
* Credit Field of Education ID - A code that records details of the field of education of the VET study for which credit/RPL was offered. Valid codes are in the range 0100 - 1299 and can be found on the http://heimshelp.education.gov.au/sites/heimshelp/resources/pages/appendices[Heims Help website]
* Credit offered provider code - A code indicating the Higher Education Provider where the studies for which the credit/RPL was offered were undertaken. Valid codes are in the range of 1000 to 6000 and can be found on the http://heimshelp.education.gov.au/sites/heimshelp/resources/pages/appendices[Heims Help website]
* Credit type - select from the drop down list
* Credit provider type - select from the drop down list
* Credit level - select from the drop down list

[[FEEHELP-exportingData]]
=== Exporting VSL

The export process for VSL is very simple provided all your data has been entered correctly. Simply go to the Enrolments window in onCourse, highlight the enrolments you wish to export then click the cogwheel and select 'Execute script' > 'VSL Export'.

This will not only export the data, but will push it to the TCSI system for reporting.
