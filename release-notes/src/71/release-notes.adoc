= Release 71
18 Mar. 2021

== Major features

=== Assessment submissions

An entirely new part of onCourse has been introduced, allowing you to store and mark student submissions against assessments. This is not yet integrated with the portal, but that will come soon.



=== API tokens

To make it much easier to authenticate external services to the onCourse API we've introduced API tokens. You can create secure keys to allow external access to the API without worrying about a login and cookie handshake.
